# SastoMitho

This is an incomplete solution for a food delivery web-app designed for a company called 'SastoMitho' in Nepal. After some months, the initiative was cancelled and the solution was abandoned. I am reviving this solution in this GitHub repository to act as a proof that I spent 3 months coding this solution and to hopefully turn this into a educational project to help other novice programmers to wrap their heads around MVC and websites.

I have deleted the Facebook and Google API keys from the Startup_Auth.cs file, so the solution will not be functional(although it barely is otherwise) until the keys are added.
