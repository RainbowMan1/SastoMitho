# SastoMitho

This is an incomplete solution for a food delivery web-app designed for a company called 'SastoMitho' in Nepal. After some months, the initiative was cancelled and the solution was abandoned. We(a friend of mine and I) are reviving this solution in this GitHub repository to act as a proof that we spent 3 months coding this solution and to hopefully turn this into an educational project to help novice programmers wrap their heads around ASP.NET MVC and websites.

The Facebook and Google API keys have been deleted from the Startup_Auth.cs file. So, the solution will not be functional(although it barely is otherwise) until the keys are added. Anyone who wishes to edit the solution are welcome to create their own API keys for the project.
